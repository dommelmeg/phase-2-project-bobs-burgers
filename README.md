# Bob's Burgers

An app based off the tv show Bob's Burgers. You can view the Burger of the Day as well as add burger suggestions. You can also view the characters from the show and favorite/unfavorite them.

## How to Use

Once you open the app, you will see the Burger of the Day loaded with a button underneath to 'Fry up a New Burger'. Clicking that button opens a form modal that allows you to input the name and price of your suggested Burger of the Day. Once you submit that, it will be added to the suggestions list below the button.

If you navigate to the Characters page, you will see a list of characters and their information. You can favorite/unfavorite characters. Favorited characters will load on the Oh My Babies! page where you are also able to unfavorite them.

## Setup

Fork and clone the repo by clicking the green code button at the top right, copy the SSH URL.

Type the following code into your terminal & replace URL with the one you just copied.

```bash
git clone URL
```

This will copy all the files from this repo down to your computer.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```
In that same terminal, run:

```bash

```
In a different terminal, run:

```
Keep this up and running while viewing the app.
